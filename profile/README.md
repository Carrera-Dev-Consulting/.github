## Hello There 👋

🙋‍♀️ What we are about 🙋‍♂️!!
---

We are software engineers who love to program and work together to learn and build better systems daily. We love learning new problem sets and strive to solve issues with common sense approaches that are maintainable and perform at a reasonable speed.

🖋️ How to Contribute 📖!!
---

We have tons of open source projects and love when anyone wants to contribute to our libraries and services. If you want to each repo should have a contribution guide that you can use to help you figure out how to build your PR's and get your changes approved and or issues raised.

👓 Where are our docs 👀?
---

We use github pages to host our documentation at [https://consulting.gxldcptrick.dev](https://consulting.gxldcptrick.dev) and just like other accounts using github pages you can access each individual repo under their name with `/repo-name`
